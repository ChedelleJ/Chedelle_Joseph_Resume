# Chedelle_Joseph_Resume
I am a Graphic Designer and an aspiring Web developer. I believe one can never be done with learning and that being diversely educated can open many doors for you. 
I enjoy leaning new things and taking on new challenges.
This is my Digital resume, I completed this in the intro to web course through CodeSpace.
My next course is Web Development.
